# Showtime
ShowTime is a web application that has been developed to streamline workflow

Our target market is project based small and medium sized firms

We provide value to our clients by helping them identify bottlenecks in their operations and providing them a platform to easily reallocate tasks to alleviate these bottlenecks

Our product is subscription based and we use a penetration pricing model to capture as large a market share as possible

The subscription fee is based on the number of users per client and we charge S$50 for up to 50 users and S$100 for 50 - 200 users

By utilising cloud servers, we are able to expand quickly both locally and globally.
